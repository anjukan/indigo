<p>Anjukan Kathirgamanathan is pursuing a PhD at the Energy Institute at University College Dublin and is passionate about 
using machine learning and data-driven techniques to make the world a more sustainable place. My research is looking at the 
use of data-driven predictive control in buildings, thereby harnessing energy flexibility to allow increasing renewable 
energy penetration in the future smart electricity grid.</p>

<p>Anjukan completed his BE(Hons) at the University of Auckland, New Zealand specialising in Mechanical Engineering. He is the
president of the UCD ASHRAE Student Chapter, part of the UCD Sustainable Energy Community, a leadership network member
of the Asia New Zealand Foundation and a Rotary Young Leaders Award recipient.</p>
